# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
> I am most proud of being able  to implement a solution to the Final Practice #5 problem, as it was a bit more complex combining conditionals into a method. While it took a lot of troubleshooting, it was rewarding to finally get it a working solution in the end.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
> Using methods in our applications has proven to be extremely helpful by reducing the needs for duplicate code (duplicate work / actions) by adding a task/function into a reusable piece of code. Super efficient!
